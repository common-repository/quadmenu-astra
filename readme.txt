Integrates QuadMenu with the Astra theme. Requires QuadMenu and Astra.

This plugin will add all the settings to match the style and the layout of Astra theme.

== Customize ==

Finally, we must stand out the integration with the customizer dashboard. This is a feature thatâ€™s only available in the premium megamenu version and is an important feature if you will include this plugin in your themes project, as this allows you and your end users to tweak all menu color scheme or layout settings and see the effect of that changes in real time.
